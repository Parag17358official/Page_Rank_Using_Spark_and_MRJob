This research investigates the integration of the PageRank algorithm, a key metric for evaluating webpage hierarchy, into the domain of distributed computing. 
PageRank measures the popularity of webpages through a stochastic process resembling the navigation of a random surfer. The study focuses on tackling the computational challenges associatedwith PageRank in distributed systems, leveraging the inherent Markovian properties inherent in random walks.
Our methodology centers on the application of map-reduce and Spark frameworks, facilitating scalable computations suitable for large-scale networks. We delve into the formal connection between Markov chains and the PageRank algorithm, elucidating the intrinsic significance of nodes in diverse network structures. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive implementation of the algorithm using MR Job, offering insights into the dynamic evolution of PageRank scores.
The experimental design encompasses the manipulation of damping factors and iterations, allowing for a thorough analysis of convergence behavior under various computational scenarios.Through meticulous examination of the results, we discern patterns, anomalies, and the impact
of parameter adjustments on PageRank scores. The findings contribute valuable insights into the fundamental dynamics of PageRank and its adaptability to distributed computing environments.

Functioning as a probability distribution, PageRank embodies the likelihood that a user navigating through links randomly reaches a particular page. Despite recent efforts focusing on enhancing random walks in distributed networks, a noticeable gap persists in establishing verified results for the efficient distributed computation of PageRanks. This gap is attributed to the time complexity of finding eigenvalues, which is on the order of O(n^3). Consequently, iterative approaches involving matrix-vector multiplications until approximate convergence are employed to address this
challenge.
In addition to linear algebraic methods, such as the Power Iteration, an alternative prevalent approach for computing PageRanks is the Monte Carlo method. The Monte Carlo method, specifically, centers on the fundamental idea of approximating PageRanks by directly simulating the associated random walk and subsequently inferring the stationary distribution based on the observed distribution throughout the walk.
This investigation employs a straightforward Monte Carlo approach for simulating PageRank , but the primary focus of our research lies in the computation of PageRanks, leveraging the Markovian properties inherent in random walks within a distributed system. The methodology involves utilizing map reduce and Spark to achieve efficient and scalable computations in this context
